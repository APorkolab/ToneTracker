# 🚀 ToneTracker Deployment Guide

This guide explains how ToneTracker is deployed using GitHub Pages with a custom domain and automated CI/CD pipeline.

## 🏗️ Deployment Architecture

ToneTracker uses a modern deployment pipeline with the following components:

- **Build System**: Vite for optimized production builds
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for static site hosting
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Custom Domain**: `tonetracker.app` with HTTPS
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization and lighthouse auditing

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:

1. **Repository Access**: Write access to the ToneTracker GitHub repository
2. **Domain Setup**: DNS records properly configured for `tonetracker.app`
3. **GitHub Pages**: Enabled in repository settings
4. **Node.js**: Version 20+ for local development and testing

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

The CI/CD pipeline consists of four main jobs:

#### **Quality Job** 🔍
- Runs ESLint and Prettier checks
- Executes unit tests with Vitest
- Generates test coverage reports
- Performs security audits

#### **E2E Job** 🎭
- Runs Playwright end-to-end tests
- Tests production build functionality
- Uploads test artifacts on failure

#### **Deploy Job** 🚀
- Builds production-optimized bundle
- Copies CNAME file to dist directory
- Validates build output
- Analyzes bundle size with bundlesize
- Runs Lighthouse performance audit
- Deploys to GitHub Pages with custom domain
- Uploads build and performance artifacts

#### **Notify Job** 📢
- Sends deployment status notifications
- Updates GitHub Step Summary with results

### 2. CNAME File

The `CNAME` file in the repository root contains:
```
tonetracker.app
```

This file is automatically copied to the `dist` directory during build and tells GitHub Pages to use the custom domain.

### 3. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)

Key deployment configurations:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: './',  // Relative base path for GitHub Pages
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',  // Output directory for GitHub Pages
    assetsDir: 'assets',  // Asset organization
    sourcemap: true,  // Source maps for debugging
    // Code splitting and optimization
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: { /* optimized chunks */ }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment

Deployment happens automatically when:

1. **Push to main branch**: Triggers full CI/CD pipeline
2. **Pull request**: Runs quality checks and tests (no deployment)
3. **Manual trigger**: Can be triggered from GitHub Actions tab

### Manual Deployment

To trigger a manual deployment:

1. Go to the repository's **Actions** tab
2. Select **🚀 ToneTracker CI/CD** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the `main` branch
5. Click **Run workflow**

### Local Build Testing

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview

# Or serve the dist directory
npm run serve
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

### DNS Configuration

For `tonetracker.app` to work with GitHub Pages, configure these DNS records:

#### **Apex Domain** (tonetracker.app):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
       185.199.109.153
       185.199.110.153
       185.199.111.153
```

#### **WWW Subdomain** (www.tonetracker.app):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: dr.porkolabadam.github.io
```

### GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Source should be set to **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch should be **gh-pages** (automatically created by the action)
4. Custom domain should show **tonetracker.app**
5. **Enforce HTTPS** should be enabled

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

The deployment pipeline includes several performance checks:

### Bundle Size Analysis
- Maximum JavaScript bundle size: **250kb** (gzipped)
- Maximum CSS bundle size: **50kb** (gzipped)
- Warnings appear in CI if limits are exceeded

### Lighthouse Audits
- Performance score monitoring
- Accessibility checks
- SEO validation
- Best practices compliance

### Performance Budgets

Configure in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml
bundlesize:
  - path: "dist/assets/*.js"
    maxSize: "250kb"
    compression: gzip
  - path: "dist/assets/*.css"
    maxSize: "50kb"
    compression: gzip
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Deployment Fails**
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Verify all required files exist in the build output
3. Ensure CNAME file is properly formatted
4. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

#### **Custom Domain Not Working**
1. Verify DNS records are correctly configured
2. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
3. Check that CNAME file contains only the domain name
4. Ensure HTTPS enforcement is enabled after DNS propagation

#### **Build Failures**
1. Check Node.js version compatibility (requires v20+)
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
3. Run tests locally to identify issues
4. Check ESLint and Prettier formatting

#### **Performance Issues**
1. Analyze bundle size reports in CI artifacts
2. Check Lighthouse reports for optimization suggestions
3. Review code splitting configuration in `vite.config.js`
4. Consider implementing lazy loading for non-critical features

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build && npm run preview

# Run full test suite
npm run test:run

# Check code quality
npm run lint && npm run format -- --check

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Run performance audit
npm run performance:audit
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Analytics

### Build Artifacts

Each deployment creates artifacts available for 30 days:

- **dist**: Complete build output
- **lighthouse-report**: Performance audit results
- **playwright-report**: E2E test results (on failure)
- **coverage**: Test coverage reports

### Performance Metrics

Monitor these key metrics:

- **Load Time**: Target < 3 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript < 250kb, CSS < 50kb
- **Lighthouse Score**: Performance > 90
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain > 80%

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
- No additional secrets required for basic deployment
- Consider adding secrets for advanced analytics or monitoring

### Content Security

- Static site hosting reduces security surface
- HTTPS enforced through GitHub Pages
- Regular dependency updates through npm audit
- Automated security scanning in CI pipeline
